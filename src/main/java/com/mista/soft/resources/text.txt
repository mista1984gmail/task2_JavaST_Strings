Our school was built about ten years ago. Our classroom is on the second floor. Its windows face the school-yard. There are two large windows in our classroom; a great amount of flowers grow in pots that stand on the window-sills.
It is pupils of our class who are responsible to water the flowers several times a week. And we all do it with great care and pleasure. On the walls of our classroom there are different colour maps and portraits, tables and wall newspapers.
Every pupil has a record book where our teachers write down our marks and we write down home tasks. Lessons usually take place in such a way that a teacher asks a question and the pupils who can give an answer raise their hands and the teacher calls out one of them to answer the question.
Teachers often call pupils to the blackboard to do different exercises or to write sentences from dictation. When they make a mistake, other pupil can be called out to correct a mistake or sometimes the teacher corrects it himself. After every lesson teachers give us home tasks both written and oral forms.
